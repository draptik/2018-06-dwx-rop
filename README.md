Template for using [revealjs](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

# Idea

- Clone this repo
- Run the install script
- It makes some opinionated changes (details will follow)
- You have a clean new start for your presentation

# Prerequisites

- wget
- tar

Tested with Linux and Windows.

Using RevealJs obviously requires NodeJs. This setup does not require NodeJs.

# Initial setup 

After cloning this repo:

- Run `./setup.sh`. It will remove the `.git` folder so you can start from scratch.
- `cd slides && npm install && npm start`

That's it!
